Package writer provides an easy abstraction for writing of cable MIDI and SMF (Standard MIDI File) data.

Create a new Writer to write to a MIDI cable (an io.Writer). Use WriteSMF to write a complete SMF file.

See the examples in the top level examples folder.

To connect with the MIDI ports of your computer use it with
the adapter package for rtmidi (gitlab.com/gomidi/rtmididrv) or portmidi (gitlab.com/gomidi/portmididrv).
