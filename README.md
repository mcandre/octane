# octane: MIDI adder

Hello, Operator? [ðŸŽµ MP3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcandre/octane/master/hello-operator.mp3)

# EXAMPLE

```console
$ octane -list
Polling for MIDI devices...
MIDI IN devices:

* Arturia KeyStep 32
* SQ-1 SEQ IN

MIDI OUT devices:

* Arturia KeyStep 32
* SQ-1 MIDI OUT
* SQ-1 CTRL

$ octane -transposeNote -48
Polling for MIDI devices...
Connected to MIDI IN device: SQ-1 SEQ IN
Connected to MIDI OUT device: Arturia KeyStep 32

(Play a sequence)

#0 [4 d:4] channel.NoteOn channel 0 key 48 velocity 64
#0 [1187 d:1187] channel.NoteOff channel 0 key 48
...
```

See `octane -help` for more options.

# ABOUT

Octane ferries signals between MIDI devices, with optional transformations on the data. For example, the incoming pitch from one device can be shifted up or down before it arrives at another device. This is particularly useful when some devices have large gaps in note compatibility, or use extreme pitches to indicate CC-like signals.

By default, octane copies data from all available IN devices to all available OUT devices. Optional `-in`, `-out` flags can narrow the mapping.

Octane is free and open source: fork it to introduce your own creative MIDI tweaks!

# TIPS

* Polling may complete faster when MIDI software such as Arturia Analog Lab is running. Though be careful about such software interfering with your jam sessions.
* Polling may complete faster on Linux.
* Any USB MIDI adapter hubs may obfuscate or alter device names.
* MIDI device names may differ between operating systems.
* In a pinch, many MIDI devices can serve as adapters to reach further MIDI devices, using "thru" options.
